# github_documentation Package
A Python Package for tracking inputs, outputs, dependencies in a markdown format that can be easily navigated in Github

This package can be used by installing github_documentation from PyPi or cloning this repository.

**How to Use:**
* Change the format of function docstrings to match the **Documentation_Template.txt** file
* Run main('specify repository path here') 
    * Run main('') to select the repository using tkinter
* A file titled "documentation.md" is created in the path documenting functions in your repository

Example of markdown information for this repository:

 **[Link: documentation.md](https://github.com/hestewar/github_documentation/blob/main/documentation.md)**


**Current Limitations:**
* This is my first package so thanks for your patience as it improves slowly over time **:)**
* Only works for .py and .R files
